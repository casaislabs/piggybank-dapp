# PiggyBank DApp

PiggyBank is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to securely deposit and withdraw Ether (ETH) using a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This DApp is designed to be intuitive, secure, and efficient, with a modern frontend developed in React.js and a backend powered by Solidity.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository contains the frontend of the PiggyBank DApp. The associated smart contract is hosted in a separate repository:

- Smart Contract Repository: [PiggyBank Smart Contract](https://github.com/casaislabs/piggybank-contract)

---

## üöÄ Features

### Frontend

- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can easily connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the DApp.
- **ETH Deposit**: Users can deposit ETH into the smart contract.
- **ETH Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw all available funds from the smart contract.
- **Balance Check**: Users can check both their balance on the contract and their wallet balance. Additionally, they can check the balance of any address on the contract.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend utilizes Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly, and attractive user interface.

### Backend (Smart Contract)

The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and provides the following functionalities:

- ETH Deposit and Withdrawal.
- Balance Queries.
- Protection against re-entrancy attacks using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard.

---

## üìç Smart Contract Address

The smart contract is deployed on the Sepolia Testnet at the following address:

- **Contract Address**: `0xc810bf49064D3eC2e1583a143948eD35f11d3E30`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js**: Framework for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **ethers.js**: A library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for managing the user's wallet.

### Backend

- **Solidity**: Programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum.
- **OpenZeppelin**: A library to implement secure smart contracts.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended).
- **MetaMask** browser extension installed.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Ensure the contract is deployed on the Sepolia network.

## üîç Technical Details of the PiggyBank Project

### 1. Smart Contract

- **Language**: Solidity  
- **Compiler Version**: 0.8.28  
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat  
- **Dependencies**:  
    - OpenZeppelin (for ReentrancyGuard and other security utilities).  
- **Deployment Network**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)  
- **Contract Address**: `0xc810bf49064D3eC2e1583a143948eD35f11d3E30`  

#### Key Functions:

- `deposit()`: Allows users to deposit ETH.  
- `withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw all their funds.  
- `getBalanceOf(address user)`: Returns the balance of a specific user.  

#### Events:

- `Deposited(address indexed user, uint256 amount)`  
- `Withdrawn(address indexed user, uint256 amount)`  

#### Security:

- Protection against re-entrancy attacks with `ReentrancyGuard`.

---

### 2. Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Blockchain Interaction**: ethers.js  
- **MetaMask Integration**: Uses `window.ethereum` for wallet connection.  

#### Key Components:

- `ConnectWallet`: Manages wallet connection with MetaMask.  
- `Deposit`: Allows users to deposit ETH.  
- `Withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw funds.  
- `Balance`: Displays the user‚Äôs balance.  
- `CheckBalance`: Allows checking the balance of any address on the contract.

### 7. Workflow

1. The user connects their MetaMask wallet.  
2. The frontend interacts with the smart contract using ethers.js.  
3. Contract functions (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalanceOf`) are invoked based on user actions.  
4. Events emitted by the contract (`Deposited`, `Withdrawn`) update the UI in real-time.
